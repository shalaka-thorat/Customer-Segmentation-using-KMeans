# Customer-Segmentation-using-KMeans
Customer Segmentation for Retail Industry using Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering Algorithm)

## What is the Dataset about:
The dataset contains information about certain customers from a Mall. Following are the attributes of the dataset:<br>
CustomerID: Unique id of customer<br>
Genre: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)<br>
Age: Age of the customer<br>
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in k$<br>
Spending Score (1-100): Score (out of 100) given to a customer by the mall authorities, based on the money spent and the behavior of the customer.

## Aim of the Project:
The aim of the project is to analyze data and find patterns within the customers, cluster the customers on the basis of these patterns.<br>
Part 1: Create clusters for alike customers using the data, and develop business insights depending on their annual incomes and spending scores.<br>
Part 2: Segreate customers as per their gender (column: Genre), and develop business insights.

## Approach used:
Type of Machine Learning problem: Unsupervised Learning<br>
As we are dealing with unlabelled data, we will use Unsupervised Learning Algorithms. We have create clusters and derive business insights from the generated clusters, thus we will use K-Means Clustering Algorithm.<br>
We will use following methodology for cluster creation:
1) Importing Data
2) Getting Overview of the Data
3) Selecting features: annual income and spending score column for deriving appropriate clusters
4) Data Pre-processing: Scaling if required
5) Using Elbow method to find the suitable number of clusters to be created
6) Training model using K-Means Clustering Algorithm, with number of clusters derived from Step 5
7) Generating business insights by analyzing the clusters

## Algorithm used:
We have used the following Unsupervised Learning Algorithm:

K-Means Clustering:<br>
